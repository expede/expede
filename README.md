Hey there, I'm Brooke :wave: I'm a composer-turned-programmer living in beautiful, rainy Vancouver.

Depending on the community, I'm best known for:
* [Witchcraft](https://hexdocs.pm/witchcraft/readme.html), which ports Haskell idioms to Elixir
* Specifying [Ethereum Virtual Machine improvements](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615)
* [UCAN](https://whitepaper.fission.codes/access-control/ucan/differences-from-oauth#ucan), a form of distributed, user-owned [JWT](https://jwt.io/)+[SPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public-key_infrastructure) auth

I also give conference talks. You can find many of them on my [Notist profile](https://noti.st/expede).

## What I'm (Currently) Excited About 🙌 

* Programming languages & PLT
* Distributed systems
* Database design
* Tech community
* Startups & advising

## Fission ⚛️ 

I'm the cofounder and CTO at [Fission](https://fission.codes), where we're eliminating the need for a backend & DevOps (yes, serioulsy). The web as a platform is incredibly powerful, and we're giving everyone a native app feel, right in the browser, without plugins. Filesystem, DB, user-owned accounts & data, encryption at rest, automatic offline support, privacy out of the box, and everything else you'd need to get up and running with a modern web app. No messing around with k8s, no server setup, no differences between production and your local environment.

## Conference Talks 🗣🗺 

I gives conference talks (slides [here](https://noti.st/expede)), often on the topics of functional programming, the future of programming, and models of computation.

## Tech Community 🧑‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻 

I've been involved in the tech community in Vancouer for several years now. I founded the [Vancouver Functional Programming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Functional-Programmers/), and for a few years helped organize [Code & Coffee YVR](https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/). In 2018, we ran Conf & Coffee, a 2-day tech conference.

## Witchcraft 🧙‍🔮🐈‍⬛✨ 

What started as a teaching tool at the FP Meetup turned into a suite of libraries porting common Haskell idioms into Elixir. Witchcraft is a suite of libraries that work well together, including:

* [Algae](https://hexdocs.pm/algae/readme.html)
* [Quark](https://hexdocs.pm/quark/readme.html)
* [TypeClass](https://hexdocs.pm/type_class/readme.html)
* [Witchcraft](https://hexdocs.pm/witchcraft/readme.html)

You can help support Witchcraft by getting involved here on GitHub, or contributing on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/witchcraft).

## Web3 :sparkles:🕸️:sparkles:

Web3 is so much more than blockchain, though that's obviously included

### UCAN Auth <img style="height: 1rem;" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94576903?s=200&v=4" />

I am the editor of the User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) specification. You can think about this as essentially a user-controlled, offline-first, extensible variant of OAuth that lets users directly authorize each oyther, or services to collaborate without prenegotiation.

### Ethereum <img style="height: 1rem;" src="https://ethereum.org/static/c48a5f760c34dfadcf05a208dab137cc/d1ef9/eth-diamond-rainbow.png" />

Once upon a time, I was fairly involved with Ethereum. I coauthored a number of standards in the space, including (co)authoring:

* [EIP-615: Subroutines and Static Jumps for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615)
* [EIP-902: Token Validation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-902)
* [EIP-1066: Status Codes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1066)
* [EIP-1444: Localized Messaging with Signal-to-Text](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1444)
* [EIP-2315: Simple Subroutines for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315)
* [EIP-3779: Safer Control Flow for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3779)

### Filecoin <img style="height: 1rem;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Filecoin.png/504px-Filecoin.png" />

I also been getting involved with the [Filecoin VM](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-project) design:

* [Filecoin VM Architecture](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-specs/blob/main/01-architecture.md) contributor
