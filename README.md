Hey there, I'm Brooke :wave: I'm a composer turned programmer, living in beaurtiful, rainy Vancouver.

Depending on the community, I'm best known for:
* [Witchcraft](https://hexdocs.pm/witchcraft/readme.html), which ports Haskell idioms to Elixir
* Specifying [Ethereum Virtual Machine improvements](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615)
* [UCAN](https://whitepaper.fission.codes/access-control/ucan/ucan-tokens), a form of distributed, user-owned [JWT](https://jwt.io/)+[SPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public-key_infrastructure) auth

## 🙌 What I'm (Currently) Excited About

* Programming languages & PLT
* Distributed systems
* Database design
* Tech community
* Startups & advising

## ⚛️ Fission

I'm the cofounder and CTO at [Fission](https://fission.codes), where we're eliminating the need for a backend & DevOps (yes, serioulsy). The web as a platform is incredibly powerful, and we're giving everyone a native app feel, right in the browser, without plugins. Filesystem, DB, user-owned accounts & data, encryption at rest, automatic offline support, privacy out of the box, and everything else you'd need to get up and running with a modern web app. No messing around with k8s, no server setup, no differences between production and your local environment.

## 🗣🗺 Conference Talks

I'm a frequent keynote speaker (talks [here](https://noti.st/expede)), often on the topics of the future of programming, and models of computation.

## 🧑‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻 Tech Community

I've been involved in the tech community in Vancouer for several years now. I founded the [Vancouver Functional Programming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Functional-Programmers/), and for a few years helped organize [Code & Coffee YVR](https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/). In 2018, we ran Conf & Coffee, a 2-day tech conference.

## 🧙‍🔮🐈‍⬛✨ Witchcraft

What started as a teaching tool at the FP Meetup turned into a suite of libraries porting common Haskell idioms into Elixir. Witchcraft is a suite of libraries that work well together, including:

* [Algae](https://hexdocs.pm/algae/readme.html)
* [Quark](https://hexdocs.pm/quark/readme.html)
* [TypeClass](https://hexdocs.pm/type_class/readme.html)
* [Witchcraft](https://hexdocs.pm/witchcraft/readme.html)

You can help support Witchcraft by getting involved her eon GitHub, or contributing on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/witchcraft).

## ⛓📦 Blockchain

Once upon a time, I was fairly involved with Ethereum. I coauthored a number of standards in the space, including:

* [EIP-615: Subroutines and Static Jumps for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615)
* [EIP-902: Token Validation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-902)
* [EIP-1066: Status Codes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1066)
* [EIP-1444: Localized Messaging with Signal-to-Text](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1444)
